# MEDIC-PROJECT-3.1

‘MEDIC’ is a simple Online Pharmaceutical Website created with HTML, CSS and pHp programming language. SQL database was used to store necessary data. It was made with the option to buy pharmaceutical products by simply registering and logging into the website. User can also access his private page where he can browse through his information and his usage history. Other information are given in the pdf file.

This project was made for the Software Development - IV Lab(CSE3100) course for the semester 3/1 of AUST.
